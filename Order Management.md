# Order Management

Fork this repository and solve the following problem.
---

You are a waiter at a fine restaurant where two types of people come old people and young people. Both of them give you their order with the time period required to make their dishes. Now the difference between both of them is if an old person gives you an order then you can't take other people's order and you have to wait till the order of old person gets fulfilled in the required time, but with the case of young people you can take their orders and then while their order is preparing you can take other people's order and whichever order has less time to get prepared comes first.

Your task is to complete three functions,  
first function OldPerson() that take input as name of old person and time for his order to get prepared and returns the name of the person after the designated time.  
Second YoungPerson() that takes input name of young person and time for his order to get prepared and returns the name of the person after the designated time.  
Last the execution() in which you call the functions of OldPerson(), YoungPerson() using async await and call them in such way so that it first execute the order of OldPerson and wait till their order gets executed and then take order of two Young Person and return whichever takes less time.

## Input
function OldPerson() that take input as name of old person which is String and time which is in millseconds and in Integer Format  
function YoungPerson() that take input as name of young person which is String and time which is in millseconds and in Integer Format  

## Output
function OldPerson() returns name of old person after waiting time specified in function is over  
function YoungPerson() returns name of young person after waiting time specified in function is over  

## Example

const name1="Rahul";  
const time1=1000;  
const answer1= YoungPerson(name1,time1) // returns name after waiting for time time1 millisecond  
console.log(answer1); // prints Rahul after 1second  

const name2="Mr.Kumar";  
const time2=2000;  
const answer2= OldPerson(name2,time2) // returns name after waiting for time time2 millisecond  
console.log(answer2); // prints Mr.Kumar after 2second  

const oldPersonName="Mr.Vargis",  
oldPersonTime=2000,  
person1Name="Jatin",  
person1Time=3000,  
person2Name="Piyush",  
person2Time=1000;  

execution(oldPersonName,oldPersonTime,person1Name,person1Time,person2Name,person2Time)  
// waits for 2000ms then prints Mr.Vargis  
// prints Piyush after 1000ms  
// prints Jatin after 3000ms
