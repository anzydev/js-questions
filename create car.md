You need to create an Object in Javascript with the name Car. This object will have three properties with name color, seats, nitros  
The table given below contains the properties of the object, their data type, and the value for that property.

| Property of Object | Data Type of Property | value for property |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------|
| color              | string               | "white"            |
| seats              | number               | 2                  |
| nitros             | boolean              | false              |

Create another variable msg which contains a string in it with the value  
"My car have seats seats and it is of color color"  
but the highlighted ones should state the specified number of seats and is of a particular color, as defined by the properties of the Car object.
